Given a positive integer num, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.


class Solution {
    public int findComplement(int num) {
        int cp = num;
        int sum = 0;
        while(num > 0){
            sum = (sum << 1) + 1;
            num >>= 1;
        }
        return sum - cp;
    }
}
